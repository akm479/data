# What is Duggup?
Duggup is a community platform for Computer Science enthusiasts. The platform will host non-redundant, high-quality
articles, videos, and podcasts that dives deep into the field. It is primarily targetted to the people who want to
take their CS knowledge a notch higher.

## How it would differ from other platforms?

The moderators at Duggup ensures that the content

 - is of super-high quality
 - has diversity
 - is explored with better taxonomy

# Who can contribute?

> For the first leg of the platform, we are focussing on high-quality articles. Eventually, the platform will host other content types

We believe it is a community that takes the field forward and we encourage everyone to write articles for Duggup. Since we ensure that the
content is diverse and is high in quality, we recommend that before you start writing an article on any topic

 - Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/duggup/shared_invite/zt-d1ap3y83-vgQ4nremqECO1SvOVzR4qw) community
 - Discuss your topic and see it doesn't overlap with any of our existing or in-pipeline articles
 - You start researching and once you have narrowed down the score, start your article

# Why should you contribute?

We are not yet another platform where coders/developers where they could write and share articles. We are a super relevant platform
for the entire Computer Science community. This means every article you write has to be well-researched and hence you will dive deep
into the subject/topic and understand it well; thus benefitting you.

We believe that every writer has to be a Learner first and hence when you start the journey 

In a gist

 - you will gain an online-presence
 - build your credibility as a subject matter expert
 - be a better engineer
 - collaborate with super-smart engineers from across the world
