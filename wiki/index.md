# What is Duggup?
Duggup is a community platform for Computer Science enthusiasts. The platform will host *non-redundant* and *high-quality*
articles, videos, and podcasts that dives deep into various topics from all the branches of CS.

## How it is different from others?

 - unlike other publishing media, the platform is crafted keeping the engineers in mind
 - we aim to keep content limited but worth your time - quality over quantity
 - we will cover the entire spectrum of Computer Science and not How-To tutorials
 - domain-specific taxonomy will ensure
   - non-redundant topics
   - better browsability
   - focussed learning

## Who should read Duggup?

We believe good coding skills clubbed with Data structures and algorithms could take you from `0` to `x` but
it is the deep domain knowledge and expertise that takes you from `x` to `10x`. Hence we target this platform to anyone who
wants to take their C.S. knowledge a notch higher.

# Write on Duggup

> For the first leg of the platform, we are focussing on articles. Eventually, the platform will host other content types like Videos, Podcasts, and Practice.

It is a community that takes the field forward and we encourage everyone to write articles for Duggup. The topics we want to cover
span the entire field of Computer Science ranging from Language Internals to Cryptography, to Data Mining, to Computational Biology, and to Scaling;
hence everyone is welcomed.

The entire process looks like this

 - **Join** our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/duggup/shared_invite/zt-d1ap3y83-vgQ4nremqECO1SvOVzR4qw) community.
 - **Pick a topic** you are interested in or get one from the [pipeline](/pipeline).
 - **Research** well about the topic and define the scope of your article.
 - **Draft** a skeleton and share it with everyone in the Slack community.
 - **Start writing** your article
 - **Submit** for a final review and publish.

## Why should you write?

We believe writing an article is just an outcome of excellent learning and understanding exercise. Hence before you write
anything you will research the topic and dive deep into it. Doing this repeatedly will make you a subject matter expert and will
help you build credibility around it.

Once your article is published on a super relevant platform like ours, you can wear it as a badge. By getting your article published on Duggup you will

 - build an online presence
 - build your credibility as a subject matter expert
 - be a better engineer, not just a good developer
 - collaborate with super-smart engineers from across the world
